# Menu

## Usage

### When to use a `Menu`

Use a `Menu` when you want users to:

-   Choose an action or change a setting from a list, AND
-   Only see the available choices contextually.

`Menu` is a React component to render an expandable menu of buttons. It is similar in purpose to a `<select>` element, with the distinction that it does not maintain a value. Instead, each option behaves as an action button.

If you need to display all the available options at all times, consider using a Toolbar instead. Use a `Menu` to display a list of actions after the user interacts with a button.

**Do**
Use a `Menu` to display a list of actions after the user interacts with an icon.

**Don’t** use a `Menu` for important actions that should always be visible. Use a `Toolbar` instead.

**Don’t**
Don’t use a `Menu` for frequently used actions. Use a `Toolbar` instead.

### Behavior

Generally, the parent button should indicate that interacting with it will show a `Menu`.

The parent button should retain the same visual styling regardless of whether the `Menu` is displayed or not.

### Placement

The `Menu` should typically appear directly below, or below and to the left of, the parent button. If there isn’t enough space below to display the full `Menu`, it can be displayed instead above the parent button.
